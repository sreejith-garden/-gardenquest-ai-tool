Garden Adventure Game Concept:
The player starts in a large cartoon garden with hidden traps. The goal is to find a small key hidden in a corner, avoid enemies (plants, traps, guards), and unlock the big dig site at the center. The game has 12 levels per series. Each level adds harder challenges, new weapons, and rewards.
